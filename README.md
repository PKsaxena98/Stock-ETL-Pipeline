# 📊 Stock Market ETL Pipeline Project Report

## 📄 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for stock market data. The goal is to extract stock data from an API, transform and clean it, and then load it into a structured format for analysis or storage in a database or data warehouse.

---

## 🚀 Objective
To build an automated pipeline that:
- **Extracts** historical stock price data
- **Transforms** the data by cleaning, filtering, and computing relevant metrics
- **Loads** the processed data into a destination (e.g., a CSV file, database, or visualization tool)

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation
- `yfinance` or `Alpha Vantage`: For fetching historical stock data
- `datetime`: Date filtering and formatting
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: Data visualization (optional)
- `SQLAlchemy` / `sqlite3`: For loading into databases (if applicable)

---

## 📂 Data Extraction
### 🌐 Source:
- Public APIs like **Yahoo Finance** (via `yfinance`) or **Alpha Vantage**

### 🔹 Example Workflow:
```python
yf.download('AAPL', start='2022-01-01', end='2023-01-01')
```
- Retrieves Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close for Apple Inc.

---

## 📈 Data Transformation
### Common Steps:
- Handle missing values
- Filter specific date ranges
- Compute moving averages or percentage changes
- Rename or drop irrelevant columns

### Example:
```python
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data.dropna(inplace=True)
```

---

## 📆 Data Loading
### Options:
- Save as CSV using `pandas.to_csv()`
- Load into SQLite or PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
- Send to a dashboard for visualization

### Example:
```python
data.to_csv('processed_stock_data.csv')
```

---

## 🎉 Output & Results
- Cleaned, structured dataset containing historical stock prices
- Additional indicators like moving averages, volatility, etc.
- (Optional) Dashboard or visualization showing trends

---

## 🚀 Deployment
- Schedule using `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
- Use `Airflow` or `Prefect` for orchestrating multi-step pipelines

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Integrate with live dashboards like Streamlit or Power BI
- Add anomaly detection or trend forecasting
- Store data in cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google BigQuery

---

## 🚧 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook or Python script
4. Inspect the output CSV or database table

---

## 🌟 Conclusion
This Stock ETL Pipeline enables automated data collection and transformation for financial analysis. It provides a strong foundation for building trading strategies, visual dashboards, or feeding ML models for predictions.
